## PORTFOLIO 4

Based heavily on [![MEAN.JS Logo](http://meanjs.org/img/logo-small.png)](http://meanjs.org/)

### Demo
Click here for the [Live Demo](http://asuttmiller-pf-4.herokuapp.com)

### Portfolio Overview
1. A user types in a phrase & saves.
2. Each character in the phrase is mapped randomly to an icon 1-144. This association is saved and reused across the system.*
3. Each character in the phrase is mapped randomly to a color 1-14. This association is saved and reused across the system.*
4. The phrase is then displayed as icons from a font file, with newly mapped colors.
5. The system then performs a map-reduce on all the characters in the phrases collection to return a per-character count. 
6. The tallies are displayed after every new additional phrase, with the respective mapped icon & color.

* If a race condition happens last in wins

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Downloading
```
git clone git@github.com:NeverOddOrEven/MEANJS-PF-4.git 
```

```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower installcommand to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ mongod --dbpath=~/data/db
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation. 
If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section.

## Testing
There is support for unit testing. Some unit tests have been added specific to the portfolio code.
```
$ grunt test
```
